# Project Brief: Barangay Online Services

## Overview
Barangay Online Services is a web application designed to streamline various local government services, providing an efficient and user-friendly platform for residents and barangay officials. The platform enables users to request documents, book appointments, manage personal profiles, access a directory of barangay staff and officials, and submit tickets for concerns or inquiries.

Barangay administrators will have a dedicated interface to manage user requests, approve appointments, configure available schedules, oversee submitted tickets, and manage user accounts.

## Optimization Strategies
To enhance performance and maintainability, I will implement:
