# Active Context: Barangay Online Services

## Current Focus

The project is streamlining the appointment management system for users, removing admin functionalities to be implemented separately. The focus is on providing a clean, user-friendly interface for residents to manage their own appointments.

## Recent Changes

- Initialized the project with Next.js 15.2.2 and React 19.0.0
- Set up Tailwind CSS 4.0.14 for styling
- Configured basic project structure with App Router
- Established the memory bank for project documentation
- Implemented login form with validation using Zod schema
- Created useApiFetch hook for API integration
- Set up authentication flow with backend JWT system
- Refactored appointments-list to focus on user functionality, removing admin features
- Added TypeScript interfaces for better type safety in appointments management

## Current Status

The project has moved beyond initial setup and is now implementing core functionality. The login system and basic appointment management for users are being developed.

### Implemented Features

- Basic Next.js application structure
- Tailwind CSS integration
- TypeScript configuration
- Root layout with Geist font
- Login form with validation
- API integration hook
- Authentication system foundation
- User-focused appointment listing and management

### In Progress

- User authentication flow completion
- Protected routes implementation
- Error handling for authentication edge cases
- Admin functionalities in separate directory

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Admin Interface Development**
   - Create separate admin routes and components
   - Implement admin-specific features in dedicated directory
   - Set up admin authentication and authorization

2. **User Interface Refinement**
   - Enhance appointment booking flow
   - Improve appointment status visualization
   - Add confirmation messages and error states

3. **Authentication Enhancement**
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Add user session management
   - Enhance security measures

### Short-term Goals

1. **User Dashboard**
   - Enhance dashboard layout
   - Add more user-specific features
   - Improve navigation experience

2. **Document Request Feature**
   - Design document request form
   - Create document type selection interface
   - Implement request submission flow

3. **Appointment System Enhancement**
   - Improve calendar interface
   - Enhance appointment form
   - Add validation and error handling

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

- **Component Organization**: Using a feature-based approach with shared UI components
- **Styling Strategy**: Utility-first with Tailwind CSS and component-based design with ShadCN
- **State Management**: Using React's built-in state management with TypeScript for type safety

### Design Decisions

- **UI Framework**: Using ShadCN for consistent component design
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design with progressive enhancement
- **Typography**: Using Geist font family for modern, clean typography

### Technical Considerations

- **Data Fetching**: Implementing mock data initially since this is frontend-only
- **Form Handling**: Using controlled components with TypeScript interfaces
- **Authentication**: Implementing role-based authentication flow

## Open Questions

- What specific admin features will be implemented in the separate admin interface?
- How will user roles and permissions be structured?
- What metrics should be tracked for administrative dashboard?
- How will different appointment statuses be managed between user and admin interfaces?

## Current Challenges

- Maintaining clean separation between user and admin functionalities
- Designing intuitive interfaces for varying user technical proficiency
- Implementing proper type safety across components
- Managing state and data flow effectively

## Recent Insights

- Separating user and admin functionalities improves code organization and maintainability
- TypeScript interfaces enhance code reliability and developer experience
- Clear component boundaries make the codebase more maintainable
- User experience benefits from focused, role-specific interfaces
