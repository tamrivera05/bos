# Active Context: Barangay Online Services

## Current Focus
The project is currently in the initial setup phase. The Next.js application has been bootstrapped with create-next-app, and the basic project structure is in place. The focus is on establishing the foundation for the Barangay Online Services platform.

## Recent Changes
- Initialized the project with Next.js 15.2.2 and React 19.0.0
- Set up Tailwind CSS 4.0.14 for styling
- Configured basic project structure with App Router
- Established the memory bank for project documentation

## Current Status
The project is at the very beginning stages with only the default Next.js starter template in place. The application currently displays the default Next.js landing page with no custom functionality implemented yet.

### Implemented Features
- Basic Next.js application structure
- Tailwind CSS integration
- TypeScript configuration
- Root layout with Geist font

### In Progress
- Project planning and architecture design
- Component structure planning
- UI/UX design considerations

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Create Project Structure**
   - Set up folder structure for components, layouts, and features
   - Establish routing organization using App Router route groups

2. **Design System Implementation**
   - Implement ShadCN UI components
   - Create base UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
   - Set up theme configuration for light/dark mode

3. **Authentication Foundation**
   - Create authentication pages (login, register)
   - Set up form components with validation
   - Implement protected routes structure

### Short-term Goals
1. **User Dashboard**
   - Create dashboard layout
   - Implement navigation components
   - Design dashboard overview page

2. **Document Request Feature**
   - Design document request form
   - Create document type selection interface
   - Implement request submission flow

3. **Appointment Booking System**
   - Design calendar interface
   - Create appointment form
   - Implement time slot selection

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Component Organization**: Using a feature-based approach with shared UI components
- **Styling Strategy**: Utility-first with Tailwind CSS and component-based design with ShadCN
- **State Management**: Starting with React's built-in state management; will evaluate need for additional libraries as complexity grows

### Design Decisions
- **UI Framework**: Using ShadCN for consistent component design
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design with progressive enhancement
- **Typography**: Using Geist font family for modern, clean typography

### Technical Considerations
- **Data Fetching**: Will need to implement mock data initially since this is frontend-only
- **Form Handling**: Will need to select appropriate form libraries for complex forms
- **Authentication**: Will need to implement mock authentication flow

## Open Questions
- How will backend services be mocked for development?
- What specific document types will be supported in the initial release?
- What level of form validation is required for each feature?
- How will user roles and permissions be structured?
- What metrics should be tracked for administrative dashboard?

## Current Challenges
- Implementing a comprehensive frontend without a backend
- Designing for varying levels of technical proficiency among users
- Creating an intuitive interface for complex administrative processes
- Balancing feature richness with performance considerations

## Recent Insights
- The project will benefit from a phased approach, focusing on core features first
- User experience should prioritize simplicity and clear guidance
- Mobile optimization is critical for accessibility in the target market
- Offline capabilities should be considered for areas with poor connectivity
