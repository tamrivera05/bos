# Active Context: Barangay Online Services

## Current Focus

The project is focusing on implementing core authentication functionality and integrating with the backend API. The login system is being developed with proper form validation and error handling.

## Recent Changes

- Initialized the project with Next.js 15.2.2 and React 19.0.0
- Set up Tailwind CSS 4.0.14 for styling
- Configured basic project structure with App Router
- Established the memory bank for project documentation
- Implemented login form with validation using Zod schema
- Created useApiFetch hook for API integration
- Set up authentication flow with backend JWT system

## Current Status

The project has moved beyond initial setup and is now implementing core functionality. The login system is being developed with integration to the backend API.

### Implemented Features

- Basic Next.js application structure
- Tailwind CSS integration
- TypeScript configuration
- Root layout with Geist font
- Login form with validation
- API integration hook
- Authentication system foundation

### In Progress

- User authentication flow completion
- Protected routes implementation
- Error handling for authentication edge cases

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Create Project Structure**

   - Set up folder structure for components, layouts, and features
   - Establish routing organization using App Router route groups

2. **Design System Implementation**

   - Implement ShadCN UI components
   - Create base UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
   - Set up theme configuration for light/dark mode

3. **Authentication Foundation**
   - Create authentication pages (login, register)
   - Set up form components with validation
   - Implement protected routes structure

### Short-term Goals

1. **User Dashboard**

   - Create dashboard layout
   - Implement navigation components
   - Design dashboard overview page

2. **Document Request Feature**

   - Design document request form
   - Create document type selection interface
   - Implement request submission flow

3. **Appointment Booking System**
   - Design calendar interface
   - Create appointment form
   - Implement time slot selection

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

- **Component Organization**: Using a feature-based approach with shared UI components
- **Styling Strategy**: Utility-first with Tailwind CSS and component-based design with ShadCN
- **State Management**: Starting with React's built-in state management; will evaluate need for additional libraries as complexity grows

### Design Decisions

- **UI Framework**: Using ShadCN for consistent component design
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design with progressive enhancement
- **Typography**: Using Geist font family for modern, clean typography

### Technical Considerations

- **Data Fetching**: Will need to implement mock data initially since this is frontend-only
- **Form Handling**: Will need to select appropriate form libraries for complex forms
- **Authentication**: Will need to implement mock authentication flow

## Open Questions

- How will backend services be mocked for development?
- What specific document types will be supported in the initial release?
- What level of form validation is required for each feature?
- How will user roles and permissions be structured?
- What metrics should be tracked for administrative dashboard?

## Current Challenges

- Implementing a comprehensive frontend without a backend
- Designing for varying levels of technical proficiency among users
- Creating an intuitive interface for complex administrative processes
- Balancing feature richness with performance considerations

## Recent Insights

- The project will benefit from a phased approach, focusing on core features first
- User experience should prioritize simplicity and clear guidance
- Mobile optimization is critical for accessibility in the target market
- Offline capabilities should be considered for areas with poor connectivity
