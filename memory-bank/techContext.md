# Technical Context: Barangay Online Services

## Technology Stack

### Frontend Framework
- **Next.js 15.2.2** - React framework with App Router for server-side rendering, routing, and API functionality
- **React 19.0.0** - UI library for component-based development
- **TypeScript** - For type-safe code and improved developer experience

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS 4.0.14** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **tailwindcss-animate** - Animation utilities for Tailwind
- **clsx & tailwind-merge** - For conditional class name composition
- **Geist** - Font family from Vercel for modern typography

### UI Components
- **ShadCN** - Component library (implied in project brief, not yet implemented in dependencies)
- **Lucide React** - Icon library

### Development Tools
- **ESLint 9** - For code linting and enforcing code standards
- **TypeScript 5** - For static type checking
- **Turbopack** - For faster development builds (used with `--turbopack` flag)

## Development Environment

### Local Development
- **Development Server**: `npm run dev --turbopack`
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Production Start**: `npm run start`
- **Linting**: `npm run lint`

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers with support for ES6+ features
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices

## Technical Constraints

### Frontend-Only Scope
- This project is focused solely on frontend development
- Backend services will need to be integrated separately or mocked for development

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize for varying internet connectivity in the Philippines
- Consider low-end device performance for rural areas
- Implement lazy loading and code splitting for faster initial load times

### Accessibility Requirements
- Must be usable by residents with varying levels of technical proficiency
- Should follow WCAG guidelines for accessibility
- Support for screen readers and keyboard navigation

### Responsive Design
- Must work seamlessly on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops
- Consider offline capabilities or graceful degradation for areas with poor connectivity

## Future Technical Considerations

### Authentication
- Will need to implement secure authentication for residents and administrators
- Consider integration with government ID verification systems

### Form Handling
- Will need form validation and state management libraries
- Consider React Hook Form and Zod for form validation

### Data Management
- Will need state management for complex UI interactions
- Consider React Context API or other state management solutions

### API Integration
- Will need to connect to backend services for data persistence
- Consider implementing API client with fetch or axios

### File Uploads
- Will need to handle document uploads for supporting evidence
- Consider implementing secure file upload and preview functionality

### Notifications
- Will need to implement notification system for updates
- Consider web push notifications or email integration

## Development Practices

### Code Organization
- Feature-based folder structure
- Reusable components in shared directories
- Consistent naming conventions

### Performance Optimization
- Next.js Image component for optimized images
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Minimizing client-side JavaScript

### Testing Strategy
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- End-to-end testing with Cypress or Playwright
- Accessibility testing with axe-core

### Deployment Considerations
